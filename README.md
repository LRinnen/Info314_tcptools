## Tracert

### Amazon

#### What was the target server's IP address?

Target IP: 108.138.200.30

#### How many hops were needed to reach the target?

Unknown. After 19 hops, I was only getting * * * for the next several hops before I stopped it. These * means that the router that the traceroute went to blocked any responses from returning to me, either with a firewall or by discarding the packets that traceroute uses. Or if the router is busy with processing standard data, then it will not bother responding to the traceroute as it is considered low-priority.
